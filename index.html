    <h2>Bobby Ashley IV</h2>
    <button class = "projbut">My Projects</button>
    <p>Most of my life i didn't really know what i wanted to do. But as i got older and started to solidify my passions, i decided to pursue something in the tech field which landed me in web development. So far i couldn't be happier with the challenege and the fuffilment that this brings me daily. I am always open to trying new things and doing the best i possibly can to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
